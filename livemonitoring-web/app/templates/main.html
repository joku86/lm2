	begins as Don Vito Corleone, the head of a New York Mafia family,
	overseeshis daughter's wedding. His beloved son ichael has just come
	home from the war, but does not intend to become part of his father's
	business. T hrough Michael's life the nature of the family business
	becomes clear. The business of the family is just like the head of the
	family, kind and benevolent to those who give respect, but given to
	ruthless violence whenever anything stands against the good of the
	family. </p-tabPanel> <p-tabPanel header="Godfather II" leftIcon="fa-print">
	Francis Ford Coppola's legendary continuation and sequel to his
	landmark 1972 film, The_Godfather parallels the young Vito Corleone's
	rise with his son Michael's spiritual fall, deepening The_Godfather's
	depiction of the dark side of the American dream. In the early 1900s,
	the child Vito flees his Sicilian village for America after the local
	Mafia kills his family. Vito struggles to make a living, legally or
	illegally, for his wife and growing brood in Little Italy, killing the
	local Black Hand Fanucci after he demands his customary cut of the
	tyro's business. With Fanucci gone, Vito's communal stature grows. </p-tabPanel> <p-tabPanel

	After a break of more than 15 years, director Francis Ford Coppola and
	writer Mario Puzo returned to the well for this third and final story
	of the fictional Corleone crime family. Two decades have passed, and
	crime kingpin Michael Corleone, now divorced from his wife Kay has
	nearly succeeded in keeping his promise that his family would one day
	be completely legitimate. </p-tabPanel> </p-tabView>
